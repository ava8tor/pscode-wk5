// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)

Ask for a input, requesting that it be a integer (or whole number)

x = input

Confirm x is a integer

If x is not a integer, start from beginning and ask for a new input

If x is a number, continue


Confirm if x has a remainder 0 or 1 (or greater than 0) if divided by 2  
y = x modulo 2

If y = 0, print "[x] is a even number"

If y != 0, print "[x] is a odd number" 



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

input() function {
Ask for a input, requesting that it be a integer (or whole number)

x = input

Confirm x is a integer

If x is not a integer, start from beginning and ask for a new input

return x
}


Perform the input funtion (see above) 5 times separately and store the returned result in the following variables:
a, b, c, d, and e
a = input()
b = input()
c = input()
d = input()
e = input()


Calculate the average (avg) among the 5 inputted numbers
avg = (a + b + c + d + e) / 5

Calculate the maximum (max) value among the 5 inputted numbers
max = a
if b > max, max = b
if c > max, max = c
if d > max, max = d
if e > max, max = e

Calculate the minimum (min) value among the 5 inputted numbers
min = a
if b < min, min = b
if c < min, min = c
if d < min, min = d
if e < min, min = e

Print out the following lines:
"Input: [a], [b], [c], [d], [e]"
"Average = [avg]"
"Maximum Value = [max]"
"Minimum Value = [min]"
